\chapter{Introduction}


Information is all around us.  Society interacts with this information
in a complicated dance: information affects what we do, and we create
further information -- books, scientific papers, legislation, and
tweets -- as a result.  Information influences everything we say,
think, and do.

The point of this thesis is not to prove this point; that information
influences us in everything we do is self-evident.  This thesis will
describe a number of quantitative methods for modeling the influence of text on society.

We begin by ...

\subsection{Text}
Text data is the low-hanging fruit of most social science research
questions.  Its ubiquity is due to the ease with which it
can---must---be created, digitized, replicated, and stored.  The rate
is staggering.  In 2008, the Internet was growing at a rate of several
billion webpages per day \cite{googleblog:2008}.

Because of the ubiquity of text data, it provides most practitioners
with an extremely rich source of data: documents, one of the basic
units of information in text analysis, are an observation in an
extremely high-dimensional and interpretable space
\cite{changrtl:2009}.

- one of the central themes of this thesis is that text data serve as an observation of an underlying story underlying decisions and politics.
