In this chapter we will use the text of newspaper articles to infer a
history of the relationships between different nations.  An assumption
of our work is that the tension between two nations -- or a warm and
robust relationship between them -- is reflected by the language that
is used to discuss them.  In developing this assumption, we will
discuss two models designed to infer the relationships between pairs
of countries.

\subsection*{Text and latent spaces}
The basic unit of analysis in this chapter will be paragraphs of text
from newspaper articles which discuss pairs of countries.  We choose
paragraphs because they are small enough to have a single concrete
idea, while being large enough to describe interesting relationships.

We will use some of the same ideas presented in the last chapter to
model the text of these paragraphs, but we will use concepts from
Chapter 2 to model relationships between pairs of countries.  This
will allow us to model the history of countries over time.  An
advantage of a text-based approach to history is that we can
incorporate information from all articles of a given collection with
modest computational cost.  This means that historians and political
scientists can then search and review thousands of historical
documents at the push of a button---or identify forgotten and
overlooked incidents in history.

An important additional assumption that we will make is that each
nation can be summarized by its position in a latent space, so that
the sentiment between two nations is determined (up to stochasticity)
by the relationship between their positions in this latent space.  By
making this assumption, we will gain two benefits: the ability to
interpret these countries' positions, since they provide statistically
meaningful summaries of these countries' positions; and the ability to
make predictions about the relationships between countries, based on
their latent positions. While the last chapter's Document Influence
Model allowed us to discover themes which evolved over time and individual
documents' influence on these themes, the assumptions we will make in
this chapter will allow us to create a more rich story about the
interaction of specific textual entities---countries---over time.

\subsection*{Organization of this chapter}

In the next two sections we will develop several computational models that
link the text of a news source to the relationships between countries.

We begin with a model which infers these relationships by using using
two sources of labels about the sentiment between pairs of countries:
expert labels and labels assigned by lay paid ``workers''.  To design
this model, we will develop a set of spatio-temporal assumptions that
allow us to describe the sentiment between countries by inspecting
their relative positions in this latent space (and, inversely, to
interpret their positions based on observed sentiment).  We will
demonstrate that modeling countries with this model allows us to
create a history of foreign relations over time.  Importantly, we will
demonstrate that the sentiment inferred from two very different
sources of sentiment labels leads to strikingly similar measures of inter-state
sentiment.

After developing this supervised model, we invert this question and
ask: what sentiment is implied by the text alone of news articles?  To
answer this question, we describe an unsupervised model of the
relationship between countries to qualitatively describe these
relationships.  We then demonstrate a connection between the
unsupervised relationships and the sentiment labels we had used for
the supervised model.
