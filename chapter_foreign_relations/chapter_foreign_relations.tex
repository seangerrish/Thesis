\section{Empirical studies: comparisons with ground truth}

\label{section:experiments}

We fit and evaluate this model over news articles discussing 245
nations from twenty years of the \emph{New York Times} (NYT).  This
collection spanned the years 1987 to 2007, a period which included
both Gulf wars; the collapse of the Soviet Union; the reunification of
Germany; September 11th, 2001; and countless other world events.

\subsection{Datasets and tokenization}  We made an important
assumption that the scope of foreign sentiment discussion is at the
level of a paragraph.  We therefore used the subset of paragraphs
which discuss exactly two nations as ``documents'' $d$, a set of
257,472 distinct paragraphs which came from the foreign, business,
financial, and magazine desks of the newspaper during this period. We
used standard stopword filters and removed the geographic tags for
labeling nations from the sentiment vocabulary.

    example a score of ``slightly positive''.}

\end{figure*}

To fit the model, we asked \emph{Amazon Mechanical Turk} raters to rate the
sentiment between two nations mentioned in a paragraph in the range -5
= "mortal enemies'', $\ldots, 5 = $''very good relationship''.
With these training examples, we fit the coefficients $\beta$ of the
text regression discussed in Section~\ref{section:model}.  This
coefficient was then fixed in the joint model in
Figure~\ref{figure:gm} to allow us to learn sentiment from
paragraphs' words.  We trained and fit the model with the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Randomly select 3607 paragraphs discussing pairs of 245 countries.
  \item Label each of these paragraphs' sentiment with two ratings
    from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
  \item Hold out 42 random country pairs (244 paragraphs) for testing.
  \item Estimate sentiment model parameters $\beta$ using the training
    paragraphs.
  \item Infer the spatial sentiment model with these parameters on
    all 257,472 paragraphs.
  \item Evaluate model sentiment prediction on the heldout 244 test
    paragraphs.
\end{enumerate}

For two nations $c_1$ and $c_2$ mentioned together at time $t$, we
predict their sentiment to be $\tilde s_{c_1, c_2} = \bar x_{c_1,t}
\bar x_{c_2, t}$.  Based on this estimate, the average squared error
for heldout nations is 2.32 ($R^2=0.51$), considerably better than a
baseline of text regression, which had means-squared-error $5.53$; for
comparison, average \emph{inter-rater squared error} -- the minimum
theoretically possible given the set of Mechanical Turk ratings -- was
$1.77$, and the square of the difference \emph{between} raters was
$7.11$.  We also found that using ``pseudo observations'' with even
modest observation variance improves predictive performance; these
results are summarized in Table~\ref{figure:sse_test}.

Nations' positions are illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure:figures}.
Figures~\ref{figure:figures}(a,b) show nations' relative positions
and interactions for a two- dimensional model; heldout error slightly
increased for higher dimensions. The United States' relationship with
Iraq (see Figure~\ref{figure:figures}(c)) serves as an excellent
example of this model in action; the relationship between these
nations degrades during both the Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq
following September 9th, 2001.  Israel's relationship with the United
States demonstrates one of the model's downfalls: while Israel is
considered a close ally of the United States, the raters' 95 ratings
of these nations' mentions had mean 0.12 and standard deviation
2.65.  Because the model is only as good as its ratings, the nations
appear to have a rocky relationship.

 %   \mbox{perp}_d & = \mathbb{E_{\hat D}} \log p(w | \bar x_{d_{c1}}
 %     \bar x_{d_{c2}} ) \\

% \subsubsection*{Bivariate change point detection}
% In addition to identifying the latent positions of nations over
% time, we can pinpoint periods of great change or upheaval.  Sudden
% changes in a nation's position is an indication of newsworthy events
% in its history; simultaneous changes in two nations' positions is an
% indication that they are both taking part in these newsworthy events.

% The task of identifying sudden changes in a time-series is known as
% change point detection.  Change point detection is frequently
% addressed by simple univariate significance tests.  We consider
% changes in the statistic $\bar s_{c1,c2} := \bar x_{c1} \bar x_{c2}$
% (see Equation~\ref{figure:sentiment}).  Because $\bar s_{c1,c1}$ may
% be change significantly when either $x_{c_1}$ or $x_{c_2}$ changes, we
% search for simultaneous significant changes in $\bar x_{c_1}$, $\bar
% x_{c_2}$, and $\bar s_{c1,c2}$ (Note that $\mathbb{E}[s_{c1,c2}] \neq
% \bar s_{c1,c2}$; we compute $\bar s_{c1,c2}$ out of convenience.
