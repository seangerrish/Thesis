Traditional bibliometrics like citations are widely used for a wide
variety of purposes. 

More importantly, past work focuses on predicting citations for
corpora which have citations, while the DIM is developed for
time-series corpora without bibliometrics.  We have demonstrated
measured consistency with citations with the model, but the
information provided by the model transcends this: the influence score
has anecdotally been demonstrated to provide qualitatively
different information than citations.

\section{Conclusions and future work}

We presented a time-series topic model for finding influential
documents in long running sequential corpora.  Based only on the
changing statistics of the language in a corpus, we computed a measure
of influence that is significantly related to observed citation
counts. It would be useful to better understand how this metric is
qualitatively different from citations and other bibliometrics: expert
judgment or usage information obtained from digital libraries might be
some avenues.  We leave this for future work.

We considered several documents evaluated by the model:
\cite{brown:1993} and \cite{toole:1984}, which both had high citations
and high posterior influence; and \cite{marcus:1993}, which had high
citations and low posterior influence.
%posterior influence; and \cite{Nature.success:1969}, which had few or
%no citations and high posterior influence. These examples illustrate
%that the model can produce results
%different from citations which are still interpretable and meaningful
%to researchers: while citation counts often point to resources based
%on new or traditional ideas, the DIM points to articles which discuss
%relatively new ideas more than those which provide specific resources.
These results demonstrate not just that the model is correlated with
citations; it also suggests that the model provides qualitatively
\emph{different} information than citations.

The DIM could be made more realistic and more powerful in many
ways.  In one variant, individual documents might have their own
``windows'' of influence.  Other improvements may change the way ideas
themselves are represented, e.g. as atomic units, or \emph{memes}
\cite{leskovec:2009}.  Further variants might differently model the
flow of ideas, by modeling topics as birth and death processes, using
latent force models \cite{alvarez:2009}, or by tracking influence
\emph{between} documents, building on the ideas
of~\cite{shaparenko:2007} or~\cite{dietz:2007}. % citet

We hope to better understand the DIM in the context of traditional
metrics of influence, such as academic citations, and other metrics of
influence, such as usage data.  Understanding when this model and
established metrics differ will uncover where our metric may provide
new information that is not yet captured by existing statistics.
