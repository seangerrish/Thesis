\section{Conclusions}

Traditional bibliometrics like citations are widely used for
understanding collections of text documents.  Much of the past work
for identifying influential documents focuses on predicting citations
for corpora which have citations, while the DIM is developed for
time-series corpora without bibliometrics.  We have demonstrated
measured consistency with citations with the model, but the
information provided by the model transcends this: the influence score
has anecdotally been demonstrated to provide qualitatively different
information than citations.

Based only on the changing statistics of the language in a corpus, we
computed a measure of influence that is significantly related to
observed citation counts. That said, it would be useful to better
understand how this metric is qualitatively different from citations
and other bibliometrics: expert judgment or usage information obtained
from digital libraries might be some avenues.  We leave this for
future work.

We considered several documents evaluated by the model:
\cite{brown:1993} and \cite{toole:1984}, which both had high citations
and high posterior influence; and \cite{marcus:1993}, which had high
citations and low posterior influence.
%posterior influence; and \cite{Nature.success:1969}, which had few or
%no citations and high posterior influence. These examples illustrate
%that the model can produce results
%different from citations which are still interpretable and meaningful
%to researchers: while citation counts often point to resources based
%on new or traditional ideas, the DIM points to articles which discuss
%relatively new ideas more than those which provide specific resources.
These results demonstrate not just that the model is correlated with
citations; it also suggests that the model provides qualitatively
\emph{different} information than citations.

The DIM could be made more realistic and more powerful in many ways.
In one variant, individual documents might have their own ``windows''
of influence.  Other improvements may change the way ideas themselves
are represented, e.g. as atomic units, or \emph{memes}
\cite{leskovec:2009}.  Further variants might differently model the
flow of ideas, by modeling topics as birth and death processes, using
latent force models \cite{alvarez:2009}, or by tracking influence
\emph{between} documents, building on the ideas of Shaparenko and
Joachims~\cite{shaparenko:2007} or Dietz et
al~\cite{dietz:2007}. % citet

I also believe that it would be useful to better understand models like
the DIM in the context of traditional metrics of influence, such as
academic citations, and other metrics of influence, such as usage
data.  Having a better understanding of when this model and
established metrics differ will uncover where our metric may provide
new information that is not yet captured by existing statistics.

The work presented in this chapter assumes that the collection of
documents is described by a set of themes, and that these themes
evolve over time.  It describes each document using a mixture over
themes and a vector describing its influence on each of those themes.
This provides a sense of the current of ideas coursing through a
collection of documents.  A limitation of this approach is that it does not
provide explicit detail of the underlying elements \emph{within} this
story.  Short of post-hoc analysis of word frequencies, we do not have a sense for whether

In the next chapter I will address some of these shortcomings by
explicitly modeling the ``story'' within a collection of text
documents.  This approach will use some of the same ideas from this
chapter, including the evolution of set of latent variables over time
using hidden Markov models.  However, I will also introduce a way to
model the dyadic relationships between countries over time.
